          takes 248px off the viewport, so a 1200 column stranded ~470px of
          empty gutter on a 1920 display. 1600 fills a common desktop while
          still stopping table rows and banner copy from running to arm's
          length on an ultrawide. */}

          instead of letting it ride up under the content. box-sizing is
          border-box, so pt-16 comes out of the dvh rather than adding to it.

          The demo harness is fixed to the bottom of the viewport, so without
          the bottom padding the last thing on a page — usually the primary
          action — sat underneath it. It goes on this column rather than on
          <main> so the footer clears the harness as well. */}
