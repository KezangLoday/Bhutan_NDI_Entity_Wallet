/**
 * The authority chain a verification walks, and which link failed.
 *
 * This is the component Act 5 turns on. A capability is only as good as
 * everything above it, and that sentence means nothing until someone sees a
 * chain of four links with the third one struck through. The same capability,
 * the same person, the same counterparty — and a FAIL, because a role above
 * it was withdrawn. No diagram explains delegated authority better, which is
 * why the plan says to build this one properly.
 *
 * Drawn as a vertical chain rather than a horizontal breadcrumb: the labels
 * are long ("Business Registration", "Declaration authority"), the statuses
 * need room, and a horizontal version either truncates or scrolls sideways —
 * on the one screen where nothing may be hidden.
 *
 * The broken link is marked three ways over: the status pill names it, the
 * connector above it changes colour, and the row carries an icon. Colour
 * alone would put the entire point of the screen in a channel some readers do
 * not receive, and this is the least acceptable place in the product for that.
