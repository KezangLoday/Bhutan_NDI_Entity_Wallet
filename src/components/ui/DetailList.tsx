 * The label/value grid every detail page uses.
 *
 * A description list rather than a table: these are properties of one thing,
 * not rows of comparable things, and a dl keeps that distinction for anyone
 * reading the page with a screen reader. The label column is fixed when there
 * is room, so values line up down the page, and stacks when there is not.
 *
 * The split is a CONTAINER query, not a viewport one. This list is used both
 * across a full-width panel and inside a 380px rail, and keyed to the viewport
 * the rail version kept the two columns on a wide screen — which is how
 * "board-resolution-2026-05-18.pdf · NL/BR/2026/011" ended up broken over four
 * lines with the separator stranded on its own. What matters is the width of
 * the box the list is in, and that is exactly what a container query asks.
