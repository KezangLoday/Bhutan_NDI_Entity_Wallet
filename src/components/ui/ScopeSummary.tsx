/**
 * "What this person can do", in the two renderings the product needs.
 *
 * The single most important component here. It appears on the scope builder's
 * preview, the acceptance screen, the Controller's own authority viewer and
 * beside audit entries, and if a reader cannot check it in five seconds then
 * nothing else in the Entity Wallet lands. The sentences themselves come from
 * `scopeModel.ts`, which is a pure function on purpose — the wording gets
 * iterated far more often than the markup.
 *
 * READ mode is prose: one sentence per grant, each with its approval clause.
 * That is what someone signs up to on the acceptance screen, and what a
 * Controller checks when they want to know why something was refused.
 *
 * TABLE mode is the same information as rows. Five dimensions per grant do
 * not edit as prose and do not compare as prose either — an Owner auditing a
 * scope wants to run an eye down the approval column, which a paragraph makes
 * impossible. Both render from one model, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * Lifecycle state is not rendered inside a sentence, ever. A relation that
 * says "Dorji may present proofs" while it is suspended is a lie in prose
 * form, so the state arrives as a pill beside the block where it cannot be
 * missed. `state` is optional here precisely so a caller has to think about
 * whether the state is already visible in its own header.
