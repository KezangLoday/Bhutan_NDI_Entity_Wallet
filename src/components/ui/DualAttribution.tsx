/**
 * "Norling Logistics Pvt. Ltd. · acted by Dorji Wangchuk"
 *
 * The display convention the whole product turns on, and the reason it is a
 * component rather than a string built at each call site: it appears on audit
 * rows, approval records, activity feeds and decisions, and the one thing it
 * must never do is drift into showing only one of the two names. A component
 * cannot forget the entity; a template string in eight files eventually will.
 *
 * The entity leads and the person follows, in that order, always. A Controller
 * acted *for* the entity — they are not the entity, and they did not act for
 * themselves. Reversing the order, or dropping the entity on a narrow screen,
 * quietly reintroduces impersonation as the mental model.
 *
 * `approvedById` is a separate line rather than a third name on the same one.
 * "Who did this" and "who authorised it" answer different questions, and
 * running them together produces a sentence nobody can parse under pressure.
