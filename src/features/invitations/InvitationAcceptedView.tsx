/**
 * SCR-INV-05 — Invitation accepted. FLOW-ONB-02 step 9.
 *
 * The two kinds land in sharply different places, and the screen has to set
 * the right expectation for each (UX-EW-01 §3.2):
 *
 * - A member lands in the organisation's console, told what they can now
 *   see and — again — that acting for it is separate. The organisation is
 *   named on the button, because a person who now belongs to two
 *   organisations must be able to tell which one they have just joined.
 * - An agency official lands on a task, with the steps ahead, because
 *   accepting is where their work starts rather than ends. Those steps are
 *   Flow 5, which this prototype has not built yet; the screen says so
 *   rather than leading into a page that pretends otherwise.
