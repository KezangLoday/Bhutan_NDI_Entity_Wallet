/**
 * SCR-INV-04 — Review invitation. FLOW-ONB-02 steps 5–8.
 *
 * INFORMED CONSENT, OR IT IS NOT CONSENT
 *
 * The invitee must be able to say who invited them and what they will get
 * before they accept (UN-05, UC-05 targets 90%). So the screen names a
 * person, not a system — "{Inviter} has invited you" — and it says what the
 * invitation will not do as plainly as what it will. For a member that is
 * the sentence that stops someone believing they can now act for the
 * business (Q4).
 *
 * THE REFUSAL THAT MUST NOT READ AS A REJECTION
 *
 * Step 8 re-checks at acceptance: the inviter may have lost their authority
 * since sending (E6). When that happens the person has just consented and is
 * being turned away — the highest-risk copy in UX-EW-01 — so it reads as the
 * invitation lapsing, and names who can send a new one, and never implies
 * the person did anything wrong. A revoked invitation (E5) deliberately does
 * not say why: the reason is between the inviter and nobody else.
 *
 * NO ACCOUNT, NO DEAD END
 *
 * Someone without an account is sent to create one and promised the way
 * back (A1) — because leaving an invitation to sign up is exactly where
 * invitees are lost. The sign-up is pre-filled with the invited address, so
 * the account is created for the address the invitation was sent to.
