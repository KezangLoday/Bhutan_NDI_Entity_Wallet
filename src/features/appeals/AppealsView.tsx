/**
 * D6 — appeals. The act that makes revocation something other than arbitrary
 * power, and the one most likely to be cut for time.
 *
 * IT IS NOT WORTH CUTTING
 *
 * The whole product is a machine for withdrawing authority quickly. Without a
 * route to challenge a withdrawal, that machine has no counterweight, and
 * every governance conversation about it will stall on the same question. The
 * screen exists so the answer is a click rather than a paragraph.
 *
 * WHO SEES WHAT
 *
 * A holder sees their own notices and can submit against them. An owner sees
 * appeals raised against the entity and decides them. Same screen, because
 * they are the same object — but the actions differ, and neither is shown the
 * other's. An owner given a "submit an appeal" form would be nonsense; a
 * holder given "uphold" would be worse.
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS COPY, NOT A GRAPHIC
 *
 * Ten working days to appeal and five to decide are provisional, pending the
 * governance framework. They live in the fixture and print as text, so
 * changing them is an edit rather than a redraw — which is exactly what the
 * brief asks for when it flags them as unsettled.
