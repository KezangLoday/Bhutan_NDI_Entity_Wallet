/**
 * SCR-ONB-01 — Sign up. FLOW-ONB-01 step 1.
 *
 * An email address, and nothing else. No name, no organisation, no national
 * ID: the account this creates is a shell that can do nothing (§7.3), and
 * everything a reader might expect to be collected here is collected later,
 * by the flow that needs it.
 *
 * THE ERROR THAT SAYS NOTHING, ON PURPOSE
 *
 * An address that is already registered (E1) and a request the rate limiter
 * refused (E7) render the same message, at the same speed (S3, UXD-02).
 * Telling someone "that address is taken" is friendlier and turns this form
 * into a way to test which addresses have accounts. The specification lists
 * two slightly different second sentences for E1 and E7 and then flags that
 * they must match; this screen uses one message for both, which is the only
 * reading that satisfies the rule it is flagged against.
 *
 * The delay before the next screen is the same whether the address is taken
 * or not — the check happens inside the wait, not before it — because a
 * refusal that comes back faster than a success is the same leak by a
 * different channel.
 *
 * THE NOTICE BEFORE THE FIELD
 *
 * Proxy sign-up — an accountant or a relative creating the account — cannot
 * be detected here (UXD-09). The only in-product control is a notice read
 * before the address is typed, so it sits above the field rather than under
 * it. Identity anchoring when the organisation is registered is the real
 * control, and it fails in the right place.
