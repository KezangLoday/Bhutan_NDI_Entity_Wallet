/**
 * The scope grammar — structured authority rendered as English.
 *
 * This is the product's conceptual core. If someone cannot read a scope and
 * tell you what a person may and may not do, nothing else in the Entity
 * Wallet matters, so the formatter is a pure function kept apart from any
 * component: it is the thing that gets iterated twenty times, and it should
 * be possible to change a word without touching JSX.
 *
 * WHAT WRITING THE SENTENCES BY HAND TAUGHT US
 *
 * Six were drafted before any of this existed, and three of them broke the
 * model that seemed obvious at the time:
 *
 *  1. "Dorji may present proofs using Business Registration credentials to
 *      BNSW and Bank of Bhutan, until 31 Dec 2026. Every presentation needs
 *      one approver."
 *      — fine. This is the shape everything else was measured against.
 *
 *  2. "Dorji may accept credential offers of any type, until 31 Dec 2026.
 *      Accepting happens straight away, with no approver."
 *      — broke the first model. The approval clause is per operation, not per
 *      relation: accepting is automatic while presenting needs a signature.
 *      A single trailing sentence about approval can only ever be true when
 *      every operation agrees, which is the uncommon case. Hence one sentence
 *      per grant, and `describeRelation` returning a list.
 *
 *  3. "Rinzin may do anything the entity can do, with no end date."
 *      — broke it again. Enumerating six operations, each "of any type, to
 *      any relying party", is technically the same information and useless to
 *      read. Full scope is a special case with its own sentence.
 *
 *  4. "Dorji may create connections with anyone, until 31 Dec 2026."
 *      — fine, and confirmed that operations with no meaningful credential or
 *      relying-party dimension must not print empty clauses about them.
 *
 *  5. "Karma may present proofs using Tax Clearance Certificate credentials
 *      to Bank of Bhutan, until 31 Dec 2026. Every presentation needs two
 *      approvers."
 *      — fine, but note the status is nowhere in the sentence. Karma's
 *      relation is terminated. Lifecycle state belongs to a `StatusPill`
 *      beside the sentence, never inside it: a sentence that says "may" while
 *      the relation is dead is a sentence that lies, and the fix is to put the
 *      state where it cannot be missed rather than to bury a negation in the
 *      prose.
 *
 *  6. "Dorji may not present proofs to anyone else."
 *      — the negative. Deliberately NOT generated: an authority is defined by
 *      what it permits, and a UI that tries to enumerate everything a person
 *      cannot do will be wrong the moment the operation list grows. The
 *      "only" in `describeGrant`'s relying-party clause carries this instead,
 *      and denial gets stated concretely at the point of denial — where the
 *      server has told us which rule bit.
 *
 * Everything here is presentation. Nothing in this file decides whether an
 * operation is permitted; that answer arrives from the server as a
 * `ScopeDecision`.

/**
 * Each operation, with its own way of talking about itself.
 *
 * An earlier version shared one clause template across every operation and
 * produced "may accept credential offers using Business Registration
 * credentials" and "may see the credentials the entity holds of any type".
 * Both are wrong English, and the shared template was why: the credential
 * dimension is a *filter on what is accepted* for one operation and a
 * *choice of what to show* for another, so it cannot share a preposition.
 *
 * `gateable` marks the operations an approval policy can meaningfully hold
 * back. Being sent an offer and reading a list are not decisions anybody
 * approves, and "each view happens straight away, with no approver" is a
 * sentence that makes the reader wonder what they missed.
