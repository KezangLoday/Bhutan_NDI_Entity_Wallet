 * B2 — a Controller's own view of what they may do. Read-only, and the fact
 * that it is read-only is the point.
 *
 * There is no edit affordance anywhere on this screen, not even a disabled
 * one. A Controller can never change their own scope, and a greyed-out "edit"
 * button would tell them that self-service is a thing that exists and they
 * merely lack the permission — which is the wrong model of the whole product.
 * What replaces it is a request that goes to the owner.
 *
 * The screen answers three questions in order: what may I do, why can I do it,
 * and what have I done. The middle one matters more than it looks — a
 * Controller who can see the board resolution their authority rests on
 * understands their position very differently from one who just has buttons.
