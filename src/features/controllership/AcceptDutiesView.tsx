/**
 * C4 — the Controller's informed acceptance. A trust-defining moment, and
 * the screen the plan says to run the comprehension test on.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS NOT A TERMS CHECKBOX
 *
 * The authority comes first and in full, before any duty or any button. A
 * person cannot meaningfully accept duties attached to an authority they have
 * not read, and putting the summary below the fold, or behind a "view
 * details" link, turns this into the thing every user has learned to click
 * past. The order is: here is exactly what you may do, here is what you take
 * on by accepting, now decide.
 *
 * Declining is a real, equal option — a button of the same weight, not a grey
 * link. If the only easy path is acceptance then the acceptance means
 * nothing, and this is precisely the record that has to mean something later.
 *
 * No statute numbers anywhere in the copy. The duties come from the Act, and
 * a reader who needs the citation is not the reader this screen is for; a
 * person deciding whether to take on an obligation needs to know what the
 * obligation is in words they can act on.
