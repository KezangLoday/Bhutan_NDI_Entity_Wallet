/**
 * A4 — accept the entity's foundational credential. The milestone.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN SCREEN RATHER THAN A STEP IN A SETUP WIZARD
 *
 * This is the root every later credential and every delegated authority
 * chains back to. When Act 5 shows a verification walking four links up to
 * the company's registration, this is the link at the top. A screen that
 * treated it as one more provisioning step would leave the audience with no
 * idea why the chain has a bottom, so it is marked as an arrival: the entity
 * is now verified, and here is what that means.
 *
 * The bootstrap scope is named rather than implied. This one acceptance
 * happens under a scope created for exactly this purpose, which is the only
 * way to accept a credential before any controllership exists — a chicken and
 * egg the design resolves explicitly, and the screen should not pretend it
 * was not there.
 *
 * TWO WAYS IN, ONE MILESTONE
 *
 * The person arrives either having chosen an organisation the register
 * listed, or with a manual review NDI approved. Whoever issues the
 * credential in the second case is still open for Gate 2 — the register
 * never confirmed the pair — so the prototype names NDI as the issuer after
 * a review rather than implying the register vouched for something it did
 * not. An arrival with neither is sent back: the credential is the reward
 * for a confirmation, and a screen reached by URL must not hand it out.
