/**
 * Flow 2 step 2 — the representative proves who they are, from their own
 * NDI Wallet.
 *
 * ONLY THE PERSON, NOT YET THE ORGANISATION
 *
 * This screen used to prove the person and then check them against a
 * company they had typed in. Under list-then-select it does only the first:
 * who you are is established here, and the register is asked what you
 * represent on the next screen, with your identity taken from this proof —
 * never from a field (GovTech requirements §6.1).
 *
 * WHERE PROXY SIGN-UP IS CAUGHT
 *
 * Sign-up cannot tell a director from their accountant typing (UXD-09), so
 * SCR-ONB-01 warns that the account must match the person named here. This
 * is where that is enforced: identity anchoring is the real control, and it
 * fails in the right place — with the proof in hand, before anything is
 * registered. The refusal is walkable, not just a state in the switcher,
 * because "what if someone else signed up for them?" is the question the
 * room asks.
