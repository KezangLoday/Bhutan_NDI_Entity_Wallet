/**
 * D2 — issue a Role or Capability into somebody's own wallet.
 *
 * THE PANEL THAT MATTERS IS THE CONSTRAINT PREVIEW.
 *
 * Everything an Owner sets here ends up readable by any counterparty the
 * holder deals with. That is the difference between Pattern B and a password:
 * the limits travel with the credential and are checked by whoever it is
 * shown to, not by us. So the screen shows, permanently and beside the form,
 * exactly what a verifier will read — because an Owner who cannot see that is
 * granting something they cannot reason about.
 *
 * It is rendered as the fields a verifier matches on rather than as raw JSON.
 * A verifier does receive structured data, but showing an Owner a code block
 * makes the constraints look like an implementation detail when they are the
 * entire security model.
 *
 * WHY EXPIRY IS PREFILLED SHORT
 *
 * A capability defaults to 90 days and a role to a year. Expiry is the first
 * line of defence in this model — the thing that limits the damage when a
 * revocation is late or never happens — so the default is short and the Owner
 * lengthens it deliberately. There is no open-ended option here at all,
 * unlike a controllership: an authority sitting in somebody's wallet forever
 * is the one shape of this credential nobody should be able to create by
 * accident.
