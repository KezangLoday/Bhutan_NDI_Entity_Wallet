/**
 * The holder's inbox. The plan calls this the biggest gap in the studio, and
 * it is: the product was issuer and verifier only, with nowhere for a
 * credential offered *to* the organisation to arrive.
 *
 * The decision column is what makes it more than a list. Every row already
 * carries the server's answer — in scope, needs an approver, or refused — so
 * a Controller can see before opening anything which of these they can
 * actually deal with. Finding out only after clicking in is how a queue
 * becomes a chore.
