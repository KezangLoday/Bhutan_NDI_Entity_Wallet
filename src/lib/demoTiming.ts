/**
 * Every wait in this demo is authored, because there is no server to wait for.
 *
 * Two ways to get this wrong. Make it instant and the demo dies: the Entity
 * Wallet's entire trust argument lives in waiting, denial and failure — the
 * register check, the parked approval, the verification decision. Resolve all
 * of that in 0ms and you have demoed a CRUD app. Make it realistic and nobody
 * sits through it in a room.
 *
 * So: long enough to read as work happening, short enough to narrate over,
 * and always skippable. The numbers live here rather than at their call sites
 * so the whole demo can be retuned in one edit after the first rehearsal —
 * which is when you find out that what felt right alone feels slow out loud.
 *
 * THE BUDGET, AS WALKED
 *
 * Across a full six-act run these add up to roughly:
 *
 *   act 1   search 0.7s + hand-off 2.2s + register 4.2s          ≈  7s
 *           and again if the refusal is shown                    ≈ 14s
 *   act 3   one wallet-signed approval                           ≈  2s
 *   act 4   accepting the registration offer                     ≈  2s
 *   act 5   hand-off 2.2s + decision 1.7s, twice                 ≈  8s
 *           and again if service-unreachable is shown            ≈ 12s
 *
 * — about 30 seconds of authored waiting in a 25-minute demo, or 2% of it,
 * with every one of them skippable. That is the right side of the trade: the
 * alternative is a product whose entire trust argument resolves instantly and
 * therefore reads as a CRUD app with extra words.
