/**
 * A STAND-IN for the Authority Verification Service.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING HERE.
 *
 * The standing rule in CLAUDE.md is that the UI renders server decisions and
 * never invents them — allow, deny and park arrive as values, and no screen
 * computes whether something is permitted. This file is the one deliberate
 * exception, and it is confined here on purpose.
 *
 * Act 5 of the demo needs a PASS and then a FAIL on the *same* authority,
 * where the FAIL is caused by an owner revoking a role a moment earlier. A
 * seeded pair cannot do that — it would show two canned screens with no
 * causal link, which is exactly the thing the act exists to demonstrate. So
 * something has to derive a decision from current state.
 *
 * What keeps that honest:
 *
 *  - It lives in the data layer, not in a component. No screen branches on a
 *    scope, a status or a value cap; screens render a `VerificationDecision`
 *    and nothing else. The UI is still not the authority boundary.
 *  - It is named for what it stands in for. In a real deployment this
 *    function is an HTTP call to the verification service, and the return
 *    type is already the shape that service returns.
 *  - It walks the chain the way the real thing must: every ancestor's live
 *    status, then the constraints. It does not take shortcuts that a real
 *    implementation could not take.
 *  - It fails closed. Anything it cannot establish is a FAIL, never a pass
 *    with a warning.
 *
 * If this file starts being imported by a component, something has gone
 * wrong: the store owns it, and the store hands screens the result.
