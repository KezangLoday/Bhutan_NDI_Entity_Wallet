/**
 * Bump this whenever a change to the SEED would leave a saved demo showing
 * something now known to be wrong.
 *
 * Saved state is otherwise merged over the seed, which is right for additive
 * changes — a new collection just appears — but wrong for corrections: a
 * browser that ran the demo last week would keep the old values until someone
 * pressed Reset, and the presenter is the one person who would not notice.
 * A save from a different seed version is discarded and the demo starts
 * fresh, which costs a presenter nothing they meant to keep.
 *
 *   1 — the original seed
 *   2 — DIDs corrected from did:indy to did:polygon
 *   3 — the running example: Pelden Trading, with Dorji as the director.
 *       Dorji and Rinzin swapped roles, so a version-2 save that says
 *       "driving as rinzin" meant the owner and would now mean the controller
 *       — the exact silent wrongness this guard exists to prevent.
 *   4 — Flow 1: people carry their membership role, and NDI's two platform
 *       administrators exist. The merge over the seed is shallow, so a
 *       version-3 save would bring back a people list with neither — an
 *       empty Members page and no one to approve a designation.
 *   5 — Flow 2 as list-then-select. The switcher key "A3" moved from the
 *       registration screen to the new choose-your-organisation screen, so a
 *       version-4 save holding an A3 override of "verified" would force the
 *       new screen into a state it does not have.
 *   6 — one organisation. A version-5 save would bring back the inherited
 *       Bhutan NDI and Royal University rows the seed no longer has.
 *   7 — the activity feed is Pelden's own history, not the inherited
 *       Studio issuer feed a version-6 save would keep showing.
